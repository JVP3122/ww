Weight watchers points plus tracking app

#### Purpose

I had been doing weight watchers when they made the switch from points plus to smart points (which as I understand has itself been phased out) and I moved tracking to a spreadsheet on my computer with a macro-based calculator.  Well, the macro disappeared (thanks, LibreOffice) so now I wanted to take this opportunity to learn how to play with GraphQL and build a Node/Express backend since I've only ever worked in Django before.  I "learned" GraphQL and the Node/Express backend by following along some of this playlist: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55RiY5tL51rG1x02Yyj93iypUuHYXcB_
